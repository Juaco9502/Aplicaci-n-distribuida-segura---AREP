# HOMEWORK 5 AREP (AplicaciÃ³n distribuida segura en todos sus frentes)


For the task you must build an application with the proposed architecture and deploy it on AWS using EC2 and Docker.

* 1. It must allow secure access from the browser to the application. In other words, it must guarantee user authentication, authorization and integrity.
* 2. It must have at least two computers communicating with each other and remote services access must guarantee: authentication, authorization and integrity between the services. No one can invoke the services if they are not authorized.
* 3. Explain how you would scale your security architecture to incorporate new services.

* 2. Create a key pair and generate the certificates.
* 3. Adapt the application to use these generated certificates.

# DELIVERABLES

* 1. Code on github.
* 2. Security architecture of your prototype.
* 3. Experiment video on AWS.
